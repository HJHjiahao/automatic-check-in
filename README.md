Besides the packages displayed in code, it's necessary to download the webdriver for your browser

link for chrome:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
(and move it to your browser's path, like C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/)

and then you get your driver_path, like C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chromedriver.exe

# generate alone_version.exe
1. configure environment required
2. decompress alone.7z
